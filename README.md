## Course description ##

The purpose of this course is to give students experience in the broad set of skills and tools for managing, collaborating on, and contributing to open source research projects. Transparency and replicability of research have received renewed emphasis in recent years due to the increased prevalence and sophistication of empirical and computational methods as well as the increased availability of large high frequency data sources. This course focuses on the open source programming languages of Python and R, but the principles could be applied to projects using any language.

The course will present the common open source software development workflow as an efficient structure for collaborative academic research. We will learn `Git` and GitHub basic tools and methods. We will practice multiple levels of documentation ranging from in-code docstrings to full PDF and HTML documentation tools. Students will implement continuous integration testing and regression testing in their own open source repositories. And students will learn how to set an environment with specific library and package versions. We will also discuss methods for anonymizing propietary data or creating synthetic datasets that can be used by the general public.


## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes ##

* Open Research: open source, transparent, replicable, usable, collaborative
* Altruism vs. self interest
	* Open research as a marketing tool
	* Brings collaborators to you
	* Giving something away makes others willing to give to you
	* Will your ideas be stolen if you make them open?
* Open research as a tool facilitating collaboration
* GitHub basics
	* Open source workflow
	* Issue tracking
	* Using "help wanted" labels
* Continuous integration testing
* Regression testing
* Documentation
	* Code modularity
	* Code docstrings
	* GitHub `REAME.md` files
	* Sphinx/Readthedocs documentation
	* JupyterLab notebooks
	* Separate papers, technical appendices
* Replicability
	* Setting the environment
	* synthetic/dymmy data for proprietary data
	* writing packages


<!--- ## Grades ##

Grades will be based on the four categories listed below with the corresponding weights.

Assignment                   | Points |   Percent  |
-----------------------------|--------|------------|
Problem Sets                 |   50   |    62.5%   |
Project initial presentation |    5   |     6.3%   |
Project final presentation   |    5   |     6.3%   |
Project paper                |   20   |    25.0%   |
**Total points**             | **80** | **100.0%** |

* **Homework:** I will assign 5 problem sets throughout the term.
	* You must write and submit your own computer code, although I encourage you to collaborate with your fellow students. I **DO NOT** want to see a bunch of copies of identical code. I **DO** want to see each of you learning how to code these problems so that you could do it on your own.
	* Problem set solutions, both written and code portions, will be turned in via a pull request from your private [GitHub.com](https://git-scm.com/) repository which is a fork of the class master repository on my account. (You will need to set up a GitHub account if you do not already have one.)
	* Problem sets will be due on the day listed in the Daily Course Outline section of this syllabus (see below) unless otherwise specified. Late homework will not be graded.
* **Project:** The project will either be a replication of an existing structural estimation paper or an original estimation project. I will approve each project. The final writeup of the project will be worthIt will be worth 20 points, which is equivalent to two homework assignments. The initial in-class presentation of your project proposal and your final in-class presentation of your project results will each be worth 5 points. The project write up will be due on Wednesday, March 8, the day after regular classes end (first reading day).
